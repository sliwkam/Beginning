# Beginning - The first projects in Python.

This repository contains programs which I have written to learn **Python**.

1. `Numerology` - the program determines the numerical sign based on the entered date.
2. `Year` - shows when the user reaches the age of one hundred years.
3. `Divisibility` - checks divisibility by 2.
4. `List` - checks if the argument is greater than the number entered and adding to the new list.
5. `Divisors` -determins the divisors of the entered number.
6. `List overlap` - finds the same words from two tables.
7. `Palindrome` - checks that the entered sentence is a palindrome.
8. `List comprehensions` - checks if the argument is greater than the number entered and adding to the new list (second way).
9. `Rock Paper Scissors` - simulation of the game 'Rock Paper Scissors'.
10. `Guessing game` - guessing the number chosen by the computer.
11. `List overlap comprehensions` - compares tables and returns Python set (set() method).
12. `Check primality` - checks the divisors of entered number and adds them to the new table.
13. `List ends` - adds the first and last number of the used table to the new table.
14. `Fibonacci` - returns the n-first words of the Fibonacci sequence.
15. `List remove duplicates` - creates table without duplicates .
16. `Reverse word order` - prints back to the user a string, except with the words in backwards order.
17. `Password Generator` - creates password based on the 5 levels of strength.
     - gives the password a certain length, shortening it from the beginning
     - gives the password a certain length, shortening it in random point
     - changes to upper case
     - turns letters into numbers
     - creates random password with using the Ascii Table.
18. `Cows and bulls` - simulation of guessing game (description in file).
19. `Element search` - searchs for numbers in the table using two functions, one of them is a binary search.
20. `Write to a file` - saves the data to a file.
21. `Read and dictionary` - reads data from a file and save them in dictionary.
22. `Reading and comparing` - reads file, converts values into int type and adds to list.
23. `Guessing game two` - guesses the number chosen by the user (more developed way).
